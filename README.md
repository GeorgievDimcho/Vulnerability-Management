Vulnerability Management made easy
	Add to futute work
## Nice to Have
1) Deal with pc specific paths - create setup.py (here think about NIST API key or describe for user how to get it) which changes the paths or copies the scripts to a standart location
2) create requirements file which can be used to install dependencies - pip freeze
3) create an option in the script to connect with internet and update the databases
4) add option (line) which print when were the dbs last updated
5) read_conf.py have all config variables in one file and set things up
6) Environmental variables need to be set before you can use the Azure deployment
