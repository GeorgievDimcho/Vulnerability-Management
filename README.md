## Vulnerability-Management
I created this repo as part of my master thesis. The goal is a proof of concept therefore the code can be further optimized.    
The final result of the script is an LLM-generated report, which can be found in the `reports` subfolder under the name `formatted_ai_report_30_04_2024`.

To view the report, click [here](https://github.com/GeorgievDimcho/Vulnerability-Management/blob/master/reports/formatted_ai_report_30_04_2024).
## Phase 1
Enter the directory where you cloned the repository (Downloads).
```
cd Vulnerability-Management
```
Download the vulnscan script from its creators: https://github.com/scipag/vulscan
Move the vulscan script to the nmap script dir:  
For linux:  
```
git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan scipag_vulscan
ln -s `pwd`/scipag_vulscan /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan
```
For other OS:  
1. Locate the Nmap scripts folder in the installation directory of Nmap.

2. Download the Vulscan repository manually.

3. Copy the repository folder and paste it into the scripts folder of Nmap using a file explorer.

The update.sh script from the creators of vulscan is not updated anymore and therefore it does not work. I found the follwing way around to get the recent data:  
WHERE DID I GET the allitem from describe
```
cat x* > allitems.csv
cp allitems.csv /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan
```
## Phase 2
For the sorting algorithm to function offline a local copy of the CVSS, EPSS and CISA database is needed. This can be easily downloaded from: https://github.com/trinitor/CVE-Vulnerability-Information-Downloader   
This files have to be updated manually from time to time.
## Phase 3
## Nice to Add
- create setup.py - which installes the requirements.txt automatically
- create an option in the script to automatically connect with internet and update the databases
- add option (line) which print when were the dbs last updated
- read_conf.py have all config variables in one file, to be able to easily change the weights for instance 
- Environmental variables need to be set before you can use the Azure deployment
