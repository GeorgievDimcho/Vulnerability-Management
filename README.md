## Vulnerability-Management
I created this repo as part of my master thesis. The goal is a proof of concept therefore the code can be further optimized.    
Enter the directory where you cloned the repository (Downloads).
```
cd Vulnerability-Management
```

Download the vulnscan script from its creators: https://github.com/scipag/vulscan
Move the vulscan script to the nmap script dir
For linux:  
```
git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan scipag_vulscan
ln -s `pwd`/scipag_vulscan /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan
```
for other OS locate the nmap scripts folder located in the installation directory of nmap. Download the vulscan repo manualy. Copy the repo and paste it in the scripts folder of nmap using File Explorer for instance.
1. For other operating systems, locate the Nmap scripts folder in the installation directory of Nmap.

2. Download the Vulscan repository manually.

3. Copy the repository folder and paste it into the scripts folder of Nmap using a file explorer.


The update.sh script from the creators of vulscan is not updated anymore and therefore it does not work. I found the follwing way around to get the recent data:
```
cp 
cat x* > allitems.csv
cp allitems.csv /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan
```
## Nice to Have
1) Deal with pc specific paths - create setup.py (here think about NIST API key or describe for user how to get it) which changes the paths or copies the scripts to a standart location
2) create requirements file which can be used to install dependencies - pip freeze
3) create an option in the script to connect with internet and update the databases
4) add option (line) which print when were the dbs last updated
5) read_conf.py have all config variables in one file and set things up
6) Environmental variables need to be set before you can use the Azure deployment

7) add comments to code
